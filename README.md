# Lean Startup
by Eric Reis

## Intro

Startups by nature cannot compete with established enterprises by targeting same customers using the same methods. Therefor they need to use more innovative approach which force them into unclear and unproven ground with limited resource. 

They therefore need to rigorously test their assumptions about the market viability of their product by building lightweight (low cost / quickly built) version (Minimal Viable Product). These MVP are introduce to early adopters to collect data that will inform future decisions as to what to test next, pivot or persevere. This cycle is called Build-Measure-Learn and will be repeated endlessly as part of continuous improvement.

## TL; DR

The Lean Startup approach emphasizes rapid experimentation, customer feedback, and adaptive planning to increase chances of developing products that align with market demands and achieve sustainable growth.

1. **Lean Thinking:** Apply lean manufacturing principles, such as eliminating waste and increasing efficiency using small batch, to product development. This ensures resources are used effectively and efficiently to maximize learning and innovation.

2. **Validated Learning:** Confront "leap of faith assumption" by questioning and testing them through the **Build-Measure-Learn** cycle. Assumption become validated once tested by interacting with real customers.

3. **Build-Measure-Learn Cycle:**  Create small experiment (MVP) to answer a question or validate an assumption about your client. Measure how the feature influences the customer behavior (increase in spending, repeat purchase, more word-of-mouth, etc.). Analyze the result to decide whether to pivot or persevere.

4. **Minimum Viable Product (MVP):** The MVP is the version of a new product that allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort. It's goal is to minimize the cost and time need to acquire validated learning needed to create a product that offer true value to clients.

5. **Innovation Accounting:** To improve entrepreneurial outcomes and hold innovators accountable, companies need to focus on measuring progress on key metrics, setting up milestones, prioritize working on **proven** value generating feature or **opt for a pivot**.

6. **Pivot (or Persevere):** Make a fundamental change to the product. Based on the learnings from the MVP, you must decide whether to pivot or persevere (keep improving on the current trajectory). **This decision should be data-driven**.

7. **Continuous Deployment:** Deploying your product frequently and consistently to gather feedback continuously. This reduces the cycle time of the Build-Measure-Learn loop, allowing for faster iterations and quicker learning.

## Core Concepts

### Leap of Faith Assumptions

**Definition:** The fundamental assumptions underlying a startup’s business model. These assumptions are known as "leap of faith" assumptions because they are critical to the success or failure of the venture.

Remember: You don't know who your client are and what they want until it's properly measure.

---
### Validated Learning

**Definition:** Data gathered by confronting "leap of faith assumption" by questioning and testing them through the **Build-Measure-Learn** cycle. To become validated, the assumption needs to be tested by interacting with real customers and measure using proper metrics.

**Purpose:** Reduce uncertainty about what the customer actually wants..

**Benefits:** Helps making decision grounded in reality instead of assumptions.

---
### Build-Measure-Learn Feedback Loop

**Definition:** Iterative cycle of building a MVP, gathering data of its impact on customers behavior and using the data to determine the course of action.

**Purpose:** Quickly and effectively produce product that are aligned with marked demand.

**Benefits:** Prevent waste of time and money by avoiding building products that nobody wants.
#### Components
- **Identify the Hypotheses:** Clearly define the assumptions or hypotheses that need to be tested.
- **BUILD:** Develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to test the hypothesis as quickly as possible.
- **MEASURE:** Collect data on how customers interact with the MVP to validate hypothesis.
- **Analyze the Data:** Assess the data collected to understand customer behavior and preferences.
- **LEARN (and adjust):** Use the data to refine the product and make decisions about pivoting or persevering.

**Important** 
- Start with a clear falsifiable prediction that can be effectively measured
- Data is more valuable than money

**Warning**
Do not try to improve logistic and infra before it become your primary constraint.

---
### Innovation Accounting

**Definition**:  framework used to measure, manage, and communicate the progress of innovative projects or startups. It involves establishing a baseline for key metrics, experimenting to improve those metrics, and making informed decisions to pivot or persevere based on the data.

**Purpose:** Creating a systematic approach to measure progress and validate business hypotheses. It aims to replace traditional financial accounting metrics for metrics that reflect the true progress of product development and customer engagement.

**Benefits**: 
- Data-Driven Decision Making
- Clear Measurement of Progress
- Risk Reduction
- Focus on Value Creation
- Improved Communication
- Continuous Improvement
#### Steps
 1. **Establish the baseline**. Where are you now, and how are you currently performing? 
 2. **Tune the engine**. Initiate your experiment to test your value or growth hypothesis. e.g. a company might spend time improving the design of its product to make it easier for new customers to use. This presupposes that the activation rate of new customers is a driver of growth and that its baseline is lower than the company would like. 
 3. Pivot or persevere. Based on the data, you can persevere with the product/features/process you now know to be correct, or pivot and test your next assumption
#### Tools
- Analytics Platforms
- A/B Testing
- Customer Feedback
- Cohort Analysis (Track and compare the behavior of different user groups over time)
- Dashboards
- Qualitative feedback
- Quantitative feedback

---
### Metrics
- **Actionable Metrics**: Provide clear guidance on what actions to take next. They are tied directly to specific and repeatable tasks that can be optimized.
- **Vanity Metrics**: Appear impressive but do not offer insights that lead to actionable steps. They can mislead and create a false sense of progress
#### The 3 A’s of Metrics

1. **Actionable**: Clear cause and effect between experiment and metric.
2. **Accessible**: Make the reports as simple as possible so everyone understands them.
3. **Auditable**: You must be able to test the data by hand.

---
### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

**Definition:** The simplest version of a product that can be released to start the learning process.
**Purpose:** To test the fundamental business hypotheses **quickly** and with **minimal cost**.
**Benefits:** Helps in avoiding building products that nobody wants.
#### Types of MVP
- **Video MVP:** Explain the concept and ask people to sign up.
- **Concierge MVP:** Do everything yourself to create an awesome personalized experience. Caution – you need to have a growth model, otherwise, you might become satisfied with a small profitable business when a pivot may have lead to more significant growth.
- **Wizard of Oz MVP:** Simulate the technology you would need to develop by doing it yourself behind the scenes while you test your assumptions.

**Must be:** 
- Quick to execute
- Inexpensive

**Important**
- Always work on minimizing the time through the loop.
- Test the most important assumptions (value and growth hypothesis) first.
- As you build an MVP, **remove any feature, process, or effort that does not contribute directly to the learning you seek.**
- Low-quality MVPs only work for early adopters. Mainstream customers have a different set of requirements and are much more demanding.

### Continuous Improvement

 **Actionable Metrics**: Provide clear guidance on what actions to take next. They are tied directly to specific and repeatable tasks that can be optimized.
 
**Vanity Metrics**: Appear impressive but do not offer insights that lead to actionable steps. They can mislead and create a false sense of progress.
  
Metrics should be:
1. **Actionable**: Clear cause and effect between experiment and metric.
2. **Accessible**: Make the reports as simple as possible so everyone understands them.
3. **Auditable**: You must be able to test the data by hand.

---
### Pivot
A structured course correction designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, strategy, and engine of growth. Creates a new MVP

**Types of Pivots:**

- **Zoom-in Pivot:** Focuses on a single feature that becomes the whole product.
- **Zoom-out Pivot:** The entire product becomes a single feature of a much larger product.
- **Customer Segment Pivot:** The product is changed to solve the needs of a different customer segment.
- **Customer Need Pivot:** The problem we were trying to solve turns out to not be very important. However, we discover related problems that are important in the process.
- **Platform Pivot:** A change from an application to a platform or vice versa.
- **Business Architecture Pivot:** Changes from high margin, low volume (B2C) to low margin, high volume (B2B) business model or vice versa.
- **Value Capture Pivot:** Changes the way a company captures value, such as switching from a direct sales model to a subscription model.
- **Engine of Growth Pivot:** Adjusts the growth model to seek a more scalable path.
- **Channel Pivot:** Changes the way a product is delivered to customers.
- **Technology Pivot:** Adopts a new technology to achieve the same solution

**Challenges of Pivoting:**

- Emotional and psychological challenges for founders and team members.
- Requires clear communication and alignment within the team to execute effectively.

### Engine of growth 
The engine of growth is the mechanism that startups use to achieve sustainable growth, meaning when new customers come from the actions of past customers.

Excludes all one-time activities that generate a surge of customers but have no long-term impact, such as a single advertisement or a publicity stunt that might be used to jump-start growth but could not sustain that growth for the long term.
#### 4 Ways Past Customers Drive Sustainable Growth

1. Word of mouth
2. As a side effect of product usage (includes luxury good and status symbols, customer walking around with a Starbucks sup can influence passerby to get some too)
3. Through funded advertising
4. Through repeat purchase or use

**Three primary type of engines of growth:**

**The Sticky Engine of Growth:** Focuses on retaining existing customers by ensuring a high level of satisfaction and low churn rates. Success is measured by the percentage of customers who continue to use the product over time.
Growth rate = natural growth rate – churn rate.
  
**The Viral Engine of Growth:** Relies on customers spreading the product through word-of-mouth or other viral mechanisms. Key metrics include **viral coefficients** and the speed at which the product spreads. Viral coefficient >1 means that each person who signs up will bring, on average, more than one other person with them. On the other end with 10% you get 10 new customer with 100 and those 10 generates 1.

**The Paid Engine of Growth:** Involves acquiring new customers through paid advertising or other marketing expenditures. It is essential to ensure that the cost of acquiring a customer (CAC) is less than the lifetime value (LTV) of the customer.

**Optimization:** Each engine requires different optimization strategies:

- For the **Sticky Engine**, focus on improving customer satisfaction and retention strategies.
- For the **Viral Engine**, enhance the product’s shareability and incentivize users to refer others.
- For the **Paid Engine**, ensure efficient use of marketing spend and continually measure CAC versus LTV.

---
### Continuous Improvement

- Promote a culture of ongoing learning and improvement.
- Regularly review processes, products, and strategies to identify areas for enhancement.
- Training is important to focus on with incremental improvements.
- Use the “**Five Whys**” to work through any kind of failure.
- Most mistakes are caused by flawed systems, not bad people.
- Whenever something goes wrong, ask yourself: How could I prevent myself from being in this situation ever again?

#### The 5 Whys

- Use it whenever new problems come up.
- Everyone who is connected to the problem needs to be at the meeting.
- Explain what it is and why the team will benefit from it.

---
### Innovation
- Empower teams to make decisions and take actions based on real-time information.
- Encourage cross-functional collaboration and autonomy.
#### 3 Needed Structural Attributes

1. Scarce but secure resources
2. Independent authority to develop their business
3. A personal stake in the outcome

## Quotes

" The goal of a startup is to figure out the right thing to build – the thing customers want and will pay for – as quickly as possible."

"Customers do not tell us what they want. They reveal the truth through their action or inaction."

"Any action that does not contribute to learning about what creates value for customers is a form of waste."

"The question is not, 'Can this product be built?' Almost anything is possible. The better questions are, 'Should this product be built?' and “Can we build a sustainable business around this set of products and services?”"

"If you cannot fail, you cannot learn."

"Success is not delivering features; success is learning how to solve the customer’s problem."

"Planning is a tool that only works in the presence of a long and stable operating history, which is not the case of startups"

"If we’re building something that nobody wants, it doesn’t much matter if we’re doing it on time and on budget."

"The only way to win is to learn faster than anyone else."

"The true measure of a runway is how many pivots a startup has left: the number of opportunities it has to make a fundamental change to its business strategy."

"When the hypothesis is unclear, it’s almost impossible to experience complete failure, and without that failure, there is usually no impetus to embark on the radical change a pivot requires

"If we do not know who the customer is, we do not know what quality is."

"We must be willing to set aside our traditional professional standards to start the process of validated learning as soon as possible."

"It is not the customer, but rather our _hypothesis about the customer_, that pulls work from product development and other functions."

"Startups maintain their competitive edge by **constantly** evolving their products based on validated learning from customers."
